**INTAKE**

- the above images shows the typical ticket submission proccess for an end-user through the user panel
- Ticket fields typically include:
  - Help Topic
  - Issue Summary
  - Message/Description
- After submission, the ticket appears in the system with a timestamp and a ticket number.

**AGENT VIEW AND CATAGOTIZATION**
<img width="1920" height="500" alt="5" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/443044df-2679-4f2e-9a16-8c880fa95d17" />


- this is the typical dashboard for an agent showing all tickets organized into several catagories.
- From the Agent Dashboard, staff can view incoming tickets.
- Tickets are automatically or manually categorized to:
  - Open
  - Assigned
  - Overdue
  - Closed
- This ensures visibility and allows agents to prioritize their workload.

**WORKING THE ISSUE**

- This is where tickets gets handled with options to assign a priority, department, user, and/or SLA so that it can be worked and directed efficiently
- When handling a ticket, agents can:
  - Assign it to a department or specific team
  - Set priority level (e.g., Low, Normal, High, Emergency)
  - Attach a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to enforce response deadlines
  - Communicate with the user via threaded messages, mostly updates
  - the threads can also be used for general updates or transparent internal communication, there is also internal notes which can be seen exclusively by agents and admins
- Communication typically happens in the comments and status gets updated until it is resolved

**RESOLUTION**
- Once the issue is resolved:
  - The agent updates the ticket status to Resolved or Closed
  - The system can trigger a confirmation or feedback request to the user
  - A full ticket history remains available for auditing, knowledge base creation, or SLA review

*This simulates the flow of how IT teams work through user issues. Leveraging osTicketâ€™s built-in features, agents maintain clarity, admins track performance, and end-users experience professional service delivery.*
